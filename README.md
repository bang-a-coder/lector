Lector produces a reading enviroment, and summons a pointer that will help you read more efficient. It's sole purpose is to transfer a piece of text
in the most efficient way possible to your melting brain.

To achieve this, Lector attempts to move the pointer precisely as your eyes would move on the text. This creates a dynamic between the pointer, your eyes and
your mind. This dynamic can be expressed as "wiring in". Also known as super fucking focused on the text.
